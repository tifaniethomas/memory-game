<h1>Memory Game</h1>

As a student in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, our first project is a browser-based game. I chose memory so I could play with my six-year-old daughter, who has loved every practice game I've made so far. With her in mind, I gave the game a colorful unicorn in space theme with simple fruit graphics on the card faces. 

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the gameboard, a deck of card that shuffles at the start of every game, and a play again button that populates after a winner has been declared. 

This was a wonderful challenge in breaking apart all the pieces that go into building a game and getting them all to work together cohesively. I would like to add the option to select between themes for the cards and background in the future. 

Memory Game PsuedoCode:

4 of each fruit, 6 different fruits for 24 cards total
cards need to populate at random for the start of the game
message populates to display whose turn it is
card selected has turn animation
collect id of first choice
collect id of second choice
compare choices to find out if a match has been made
wait for 3 seconds before hiding cards if no match (this ended up being far too long, so it's 1 second now)
if there is a match, cards need to stay showing
player score gets one point added for the match
if there is not a match, cards hide again and next turn
message updates to next player turn message
when all cards are showing, player with the most points wins
there are 12 points total
if there is a tie, display tie-message
reset board button is visible to click
reset board turns all cards over and shuffles them

icebox ideas:
let there be more than one set of cards to choose from

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
Thank you so much to Michael and Victor for being so clear in explaining our lessons leading up to this project. It helped tremendously when the time came to sit down and start from scratch. Also, huge thanks to my group of classmates who were there to bounce ideas off of and have great discussions with.
